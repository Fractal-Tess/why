# WHY

## The world's most useless video player

"Why? is the question you ask yourself when you see this project. Who wants to watch a video in the terminal?

Well, I sometimes I do. Nice for testing stuff on remote VPS's without having to pull them locally.

Requires ffmpeg

Usage:
```
./why <video> <optional:scaling>
```

Scaling defaults to 1/5. The number supplied in the command becomes the denominator, e.g. 10 is 1/10.
